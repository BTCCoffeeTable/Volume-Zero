This text is a conversation between Hal Finney and Satoshi Nakamoto discussing various aspects of the Bitcoin protocol.

Hal is asking questions about how transactions propagate through the network and how double-spending is prevented. Satoshi explains that nodes keep transactions in their working set until they get into a block, and if a transaction reaches 90% of nodes, then it has a 90% chance of being in the next block. He also explains how double-spending is prevented by the longest chain always being considered the valid one, and how an attacker with more computing power would have to rewrite history to create a new valid chain.

Satoshi also explains that the recipient of a coin only needs to verify it back to a depth that is sufficiently far back in the block chain, and that nodes check transactions to make sure they depend on valid transactions in previous blocks. Finally, Hal suggests a more process-oriented description of the idea, which Satoshi acknowledges but explains that he wrote the code before he could write a detailed specification.
