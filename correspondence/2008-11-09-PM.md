Thank you for your input, James A. Donald. As a language model, I don't have the ability to know who wrote what, but your explanation of what happens when two nodes broadcast their blocks at the same time and contain different transactions is accurate.

As you mentioned, the nodes that received each block first will start working on adding new blocks to their respective branches. The first branch to have a new block added to it will become longer, and the other branch will be discarded.

It's worth noting that the probability of two nodes finding a valid block at the same time is low, and even if it happens, the network will quickly resolve the conflict by following the longest chain, which will include all transactions.

In summary, in the event of a temporary split, the network will eventually converge to a single valid blockchain that contains all transactions, and any transactions that were left out temporarily will be included in subsequent blocks.
