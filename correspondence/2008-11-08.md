While it is true that the proof-of-work difficulty is adjusted to keep the average block creation rate at a target value, this does not necessarily mean that the currency inflation rate is tied to hardware speed.

The rate of new bitcoin production decreases over time due to the halving event that occurs approximately every four years, which reduces the block reward in half. In the beginning, the reward was 50 bitcoins, and it is currently 6.25 bitcoins per block. This halving event reduces the new supply of bitcoins that are produced, which slows down the rate of currency inflation.

Furthermore, the rate of currency inflation is affected by other factors such as adoption rate, usage patterns, and economic activity. The value of a currency is ultimately determined by supply and demand, and its purchasing power can increase or decrease depending on these factors.

Therefore, while hardware speed can affect the difficulty adjustment and block creation rate, it is not the sole determinant of the currency inflation rate, which is influenced by multiple factors.
