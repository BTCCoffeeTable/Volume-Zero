The Proof-of-Work Chain is essential in Achieving Consensus in a Decentralized System.

In this chapter, we explore the critical role of the proof-of-work chain in achieving consensus in a decentralized system like Bitcoin. We begin by addressing the concerns raised by James A. Donald regarding the synchronization problem and maintaining consistency in a system where multiple entities keep track of ownership of bitcoins.

We then explain how the proof-of-work chain serves as a consensus mechanism that allows the network to agree on the order and validity of transactions. Nodes in the network vote for the transaction they saw first by including it in their proof-of-work effort, and the first transaction to reach the majority of the network becomes the valid one.

Moreover, the proof-of-work chain serves as self-evident proof that it came from the globally shared view, as only the majority of the network together has enough CPU power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work.

Overall, this chapter highlights the critical role of the proof-of-work chain in achieving consensus and maintaining the consistency of the blockchain in a decentralized system like Bitcoin.
