## INTRODUCTION

The Bitcoin whitepaper is a nine page document, in the style of an academic paper, that outlines the technical details and theoretical underpinnings of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system called Bitcoin.

Bitcoiners are apt to tell a newbie to 'read the whitepaper.' But for this chapter we will be pulling a small selection of quotes from the pape to give the reader a general sense of that which was presented in the bitcoin whitepaper.

You can find the entire whitepaper online in a litany of places. A link to the whitepaper is available at the chapter-cloisng QR which you will see at the end of each chapter in this book.

The original whitepaper is spread across PDF 9 pages.
