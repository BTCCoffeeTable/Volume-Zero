In the early days of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto found himself in a dialogue with skeptics and enthusiasts alike. One such conversation took place on the metzdowd Cryptography Mailing List, where Nakamoto addressed concerns about the potential for Bitcoin's proof-of-work system to be overwhelmed by attackers with significant computational resources, such as zombie farms.

In his response, Nakamoto clarified the resilience of the Bitcoin network, stating that as long as the collective CPU power of honest participants exceeded that of any single attacker, the network would remain secure. He further argued that smaller zombie farms, unable to overpower the network, could still profitably participate by generating bitcoins, thereby contributing to the network's security.

Nakamoto even suggested that the Bitcoin network might reduce spam by incentivizing zombie farms to generate bitcoins instead. This email showcases Nakamoto's confidence in the robustness of the Bitcoin protocol and his innovative approach to potential challenges.
