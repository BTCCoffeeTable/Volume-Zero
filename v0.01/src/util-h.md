The util.h file in the original Bitcoin source code contains the declarations of various utility functions used throughout the Bitcoin Core software. This file serves as the header file for the util.cpp file, which contains the definitions of these functions.

The util.h file includes several other header files, such as stdint.h, string.h, and vector, which are necessary for the proper functioning of the utility functions.

Some of the key utility functions declared in util.h include:

HexStr: Converts a byte array to its hexadecimal representation.
ParseHex: Converts a hexadecimal string to a byte array.
PrintHex: Prints a byte array in its hexadecimal representation.
RandBytes: Generates a random byte array of a given size.
DecodeBase58: Decodes a Base58-encoded string.
EncodeBase58: Encodes a byte array into a Base58-encoded string.
Hash256: Computes the SHA-256 hash of a byte array.
Hash160: Computes the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of a byte array.

In addition to these utility functions, util.h also declares various constants, data structures, and macros used throughout the Bitcoin Core software.
