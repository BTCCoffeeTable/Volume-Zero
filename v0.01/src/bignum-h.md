The bignum.h file in the original Bitcoin code is a header file that defines a class called CBigNum, which is used to represent large integers.

This class is used throughout the codebase to perform various operations such as modular arithmetic and representation of large integers in different bases. The CBigNum class is a wrapper around the OpenSSL library's BIGNUM class, which is a library for performing arbitrary precision arithmetic. The bignum.h file also defines several helper functions for working with CBigNum objects, such as functions for performing bitwise operations and conversion to/from string representations.

 The OpenSSL library's BIGNUM class is a library for performing arbitrary precision arithmetic, which means it can handle very large integers that can't fit into the standard integer types provided by most programming languages. The BIGNUM class provides functions for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modular arithmetic, as well as more advanced operations such as modular exponentiation and modular inversion. It also provides functions for converting BIGNUM objects to and from different representations, such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal. The BIGNUM class is designed to be fast and efficient, and it uses algorithms such as Karatsuba multiplication and Montgomery multiplication to speed up arithmetic operations.
