This is the source code of a cryptocurrency system. It defines three classes CUser, CReview, and CProduct.

CUser represents a user of the cryptocurrency system, CReview represents a review of a product, and CProduct represents a product in the system.

The code contains several methods for each class. CUser has a constructor, SetNull, GetHash, GetAtomCount, and AddAtom methods. CReview has a constructor, GetHash, GetSigHash, GetUserHash, and AcceptReview methods. CProduct has a constructor, setSources variable, and GetHash method.

The code also defines several functions: AdvertInsert, AdvertErase, and AddAtomsAndPropagate.

Line 9 defines a constant nFlowthroughRate with a value of 2.

The code uses the vector and map data structures.

The IMPLEMENT_SERIALIZE macro is used to serialize and deserialize the classes for storage on disk.

There are also some comments throughout the code to provide information on the purpose and usage of the various methods and variables.

Overall, the code appears to be an early version of a cryptocurrency system with basic functionality for managing users, products, and reviews.
