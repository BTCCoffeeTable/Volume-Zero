The irc.h file is a header file that was included in the original Bitcoin source code, and it provides a set of definitions and functions that are used to work with the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol.

The IRC protocol is a widely used communication protocol that allows multiple users to chat in real-time over the internet.

In the context of the Bitcoin software, the irc.h file defines a set of data structures that represent an IRC connection, an IRC channel, and various IRC commands. It also defines a set of functions that are used to connect to and communicate with an IRC server, join a specific IRC channel, send messages to other users in the channel, and receive messages from other users in the channel.

The primary use of the IRC protocol in the Bitcoin software was for the dissemination of information about new blocks and transactions. When a new block was mined or a new transaction was created, the Bitcoin software would broadcast this information to various IRC channels, allowing users to receive real-time updates about the state of the Bitcoin network.

However, the use of IRC for broadcasting block and transaction information has been deprecated in favor of other mechanisms such as the P2P network and the use of JSON-RPC API calls.
