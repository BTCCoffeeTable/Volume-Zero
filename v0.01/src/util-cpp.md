The util.cpp file from Bitcoin v0.01 ALPHA contains utility functions and classes essential for the software's operation. It emphasizes initializing OpenSSL for multithreading, ensuring cryptographic functions are thread-safe.

The file also focuses on seeding the random number generator using diverse sources like screen scraping and performance counters, crucial for cryptographic security in Bitcoin's transactions and block creation. Additionally, it introduces safer string formatting functions to prevent buffer overflows and ensure proper string termination.

Error reporting and exception handling mechanisms are also present. Notably, the file contains time management functions aiming to synchronize the system clock with other Bitcoin network nodes, ensuring consistent timestamping across the decentralized system. In essence, util.cpp underpins the security, reliability, and synchronization of the early Bitcoin software.
