The util.cpp file in the original Bitcoin source code contains various utility functions used throughout the Bitcoin Core software.

These functions are primarily used for common tasks such as string manipulation, byte manipulation, and cryptographic operations.

Some of the key functions defined in util.cpp include:

HexStr: Converts a byte array to its hexadecimal representation.
ParseHex: Converts a hexadecimal string to a byte array.
PrintHex: Prints a byte array in its hexadecimal representation.
RandBytes: Generates a random byte array of a given size.
DecodeBase58: Decodes a Base58-encoded string.
EncodeBase58: Encodes a byte array into a Base58-encoded string.
Hash256: Computes the SHA-256 hash of a byte array.
Hash160: Computes the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of a byte array.

These utility functions are used throughout the Bitcoin Core software for various purposes, such as encoding and decoding Bitcoin addresses, generating cryptographic keys, and computing transaction hashes.
