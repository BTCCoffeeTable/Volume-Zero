The makefile.vc file is a makefile that is included in the original Bitcoin source code, and is used to compile the Bitcoin software on Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC) on Windows operating system.

The makefile.vc file contains several rules for compiling the Bitcoin software, which include:

1. Compiling the source code: The makefile.vc file includes rules for compiling each source code file, including main.cpp, net.cpp, util.cpp, and many others.
2. Linking object files: Once all of the source code files have been compiled, the makefile.vc file includes rules for linking the object files together into the final Bitcoin executable, which is called "bitcoin.exe".
3. Defining compilation options: The makefile.vc file defines various compilation options that are used by the MSVC compiler, such as the include paths, linker options, and compiler flags.
4. Generating dependencies: The makefile.vc file also includes rules for generating dependencies between source code files, which helps to ensure that the code is recompiled when a dependency changes.
